## About Me

* Age: 20
* Location: Woodbury, TN
* Email: liamallen343@gmail.com
* Phone: (615) 308-4472

I'm a new Junior Developer, specializing in front end development, and UI/UX development. I've spent most of my life on a farm, doing manual jobs, or working in warehouse.
Since fourth grade I've been showing livestock (mainly goats) at local, state, and national levels. Along the way I've learned the value of a hard work ethic, and developed an intense drive to succeed. I've only recently gotten in to the development field, but I am genuinely enjoying it, and finding satasfaction in my work in the field. 

I graduated valedictorian from Vanderbilt's Full Stack Bootcamp with a 4.0 GPA, and a certificate for coding and have been working on improving myself every day since.

Thank you for being here! I look forward to connecting with you soon.
